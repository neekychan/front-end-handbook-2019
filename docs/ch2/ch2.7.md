<!-- 2.7 - Generalist/Full-Stack Myth -->
# 2.7 - 神话：全能/全栈

<!-- The term "Full-Stack" developer has come to take on several meanings. So many, that not one meaning is clear when the term is used. Just consider the results from the two surveys shown below. These results might lead one to believe that being a full-stack developer is commonplace. But, in my almost 20 years of experience, this is anything but the case in a professional context. -->

全栈开发者这个称谓有几种含义。这种称谓尚未有一个明确的含义。仅考虑下面两个调查所展示的结果。这结果可能会令人相信，成为一名全栈开发者是很普通的。但是，从我将近20年的经验来看，这绝对不是专业范畴的情况。

<!-- The roles to design and develop a website or web application require a deep set of skills and vast experience in the area of visual design, UI/interaction design, front-end development, and back-end development. Any person who can fill one or more of these 4 roles at a professional level is an extremely rare commodity. -->

设计和开发一个网站或网页应用的角色，在视觉设计，UI/交互设计，[前端开发](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-front-end-roadmap)和[后端开发](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-back-end-roadmap)中，需要一套很深入的技巧和丰富的经验。任何能在专业水平上胜任以上4个角色中的一个或多个的人都是极其罕见的。

<!-- Pragmatically, you should seek to be, or seek to hire, an expert in one of these roles (i.e. Visual Design, Interaction Design/IA, Front-end Dev, Back-end Dev). Those who claim to operate at an expert level at one or more of these roles are exceptionally rare. -->

实际上，你应该寻求成为或聘请这些角色（视觉设计、交互设计/IA，前端开发，后端开发）之一的专家。那些声称在一个或多个角色中达到专家生平的人是极其罕见的。

<!-- However, given that JavaScript has infiltrated all layers of a technology stack (i.e. Node.js) finding a full-stack JS developer who can code the front-end and back-end is becoming less mythical. Typically, these full-stack developers only deal with JavaScript. A developer who can code the front-end, back-end, API, and database isn't as absurd as it once was (excluding visual design, interaction design, and CSS). Still mythical in my opinion, but not as uncommon as it once was. Thus, I wouldn't recommend a developer set out to become a "full-stack" developer. In rare situations, it can work. But, as a general concept for building a career as a front-end developer, I'd focus on front-end technologies. -->

然而，考虑到JavaScript已经涵盖了技术栈的所有层面（也就是 Node.js）寻找一个既能开发前端和后端的全栈JS开发者已经不是那么神秘了。通常，这些全栈开发者只能解决JavaScript。一个能为前端，后端，API和数据库的开发者不在像以前那样荒谬（不包含视觉设计，交互设计和 CSS）。在我看来依旧很神秘，不再像以前那样不寻常了。因此，我不建议开发者成为一名全栈开发者。在少数情况下，这行得通。但一般来说，作为前端开发者的职业生涯，我会专注于前端技术。
